#  Smart Traffic Light System (Arduino)

## Project Description
This project implements a smart traffic light system using Arduino.
Signal timing changes dynamically based on traffic density input.

## 🛠 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Ultrasonic Sensor 
- Resistors
- Breadboard

## ⚙ Working
The system detects traffic density and adjusts green signal duration accordingly.
Higher traffic density → Longer green signal time.

##  Technology Used
- Arduino
- Embedded C

##  Future Improvements
- AI-based traffic prediction
- IoT-based monitoring
- Real-time traffic analytics
